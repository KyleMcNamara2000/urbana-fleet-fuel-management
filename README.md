## Overview
The City of Urbana Fleet Division manages credit cards used exclusively for fueling City-owned vehicles.  The credit card transactions collect data regarding the fuel station, amount of fuel, vehicle ID, vehicle mileage, etc.

## Evaluation criteria
- Comprehensiveness of data profiling and the creation of a generally applicable or reusable model
